This Research Project is a Crack detection project produced by **Aaron Bonner** from ATU Donegal, Letterkenny. This repository is used to show what has been done, the steps and the code used. 

This Research Project Aims to tackle the following question:
* "What are the best Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques used for crack detection in structures based on accuracy, efficiency and scalability?"


## Guide and Steps
Both YOLOv8 and YOLOv7 steps and code was got for the Repositories.
YOLOv8 Repo:  https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics

YOLOv7: https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7

The repositories where cloned and the code and steps taken follow the guide of both repositories.
Both YOLOv8 and YOLOv7 follow this layout.
1. Pre-processing and Augmentation- Using Roboflow
2. Enviroment Setup- Installing CUDA and using GPU for Training
3. Training YOLOv8 and YOLOv7 models
4. In Increments of 5 epochs for each model.
5. Performing Structural Crack Detection.
6. Evaluation of Models: Metrics like F1-Score, Precision and Recall
7. Comparison of the models.
