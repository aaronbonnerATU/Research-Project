This Research Project is a Crack detection project produced by **Aaron Bonner** from ATU Donegal, Letterkenny. This repository is used to show what has been done, the steps and the code used. 

This Research Project Aims to tackle the following question:
* "What are the best Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques used for crack detection in structures based on accuracy, efficiency and scalability?"

## Crack Detection Results:
